# simple program of Proof of work  in Python

## we used two method here 

## block_hash
### this method takes string and convert it into its digest that is 256 bit

## mine_block

### this method takes some parameter like
#### block number
#### prev hash
#### transaction
#### difficulty level 

### difficulty level 

#### it is kind of asking miner get the that input which output the hash that start with some number of zeros, so difficulty level is the number of zeros that give the hash 
#### which validate the block and add into blockchain


# Run python mine2.py 
# linux user try python3 mine.py
